Discrete mathematics is different from other math subjects. There is no distinct way in discribing discrete 
mathematics. The subject focuses on four main topics: combinatorics (the theory of ways things combine; in 
particular, how to count these ways), sequences, symbolic logic, and graph theory. 

I have learned that a statement is a declarative sentence that is either true or false but not both. A statement is atomic if it 
cannot be split into smaller statements,while a molecular statement can. Molecular statements are joined by 
logical connectives. These statements must be either true or false, which can be determined by truth conditions
for connectives.

Additionaly, I have learned about the additive and multiplicative principles. In the additive principle if event 
A can occur in m ways and event B can occur in n disjoint(A and B not happening at the same time) ways, then A 
or B can occur in m+n ways. The same can also be applied to more than two events to find the number of ways 
something can occur. On the other hand, in the multiplicative principle if event A can occur in m ways, and
each way for A allows for the same amount of ways n for event B, then it can occur in mâ‹…n ways. This can also 
be applied to sets. This further leads to finding the cardinality of a union of multiple sets, which ends up
tying in with the principle of inclusion/exclusion.

Furthermore, the number of rearrangement of objects is called a permutation. P(n,k) is the number of k permutations 
of n elements, which is the number of ways k can be arranged from n objects. C(n,k) counts the number of combinations 
for k from n total objects.

Lastly, combinatorial proofs are explanatory proofs that prove a binomial identity. There are three steps in a 
combinatorial proof. The first step in creating a counting problem that can be answered in two ways. The second
step is explaining why the answer is one way. The last step is proving why the answer is the other way. 

In the lattest chapters, I have learned about sequences and mathematical induction. A sequence is an ordered list
of numbers, keep in mind that the order of which the numbers come in in important. To refer to the entire sequence
we use a_n, where n is called an indices, which refers to n number in the sequence. We can use closed formulas for
a sequence in order to find a_n. Additionally, a sequence can be arithmitic or geometric. An arithmitic sequence 
has a constant difference in its sequence, while a geometric sequence has a constant ratio between successive terms.

Furthermore, an arithmitic sequence has a recursive definition of a_n = a_n-1 + d with a_0 = a and a closed formula
of a_n = a+dn. The geometric sequence has a recursive definition of a_n = ra_n-1 with a_0 = a and a closed formula
of a_n = a*r^n. Recursive relations can also be solved by using the characteristic equation and finding the
characteristic roots.

Lastly, we learned about Mathematical induction being a proof technique or a style of argument that can be used
to convince ourselves and others that a mathematical statement is always true. To start an inductive proof, you
say the statement that you want to prove. You then have to prove two facts, a base case and an inductive case.
