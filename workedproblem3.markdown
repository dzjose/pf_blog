`5) Prove that √3 is irrational.`
---

Assume, for a contradiction that √3 = p/q. Where p/q has no common divisors. Then, get rid of the square root
and you end up with 3 = p^2/q^2. Then by reducing the fraction you end up with 3q^2 =p^2. Thus p^2 is odd, and 
as such p is odd. So p = 3k for some integer k, so p^2 = 3k^2. We then end up having 3q^2 = 9k^2, by further 
simplifying we then have q^2 = 3k^2. Lastly, q^2 is odd and as such since p is also odd we can see that p/q
has no common divisors. Thus √3 is irrational.
