`5) Prove that âˆš3 is irrational.`
---
Assume, for a contradiction that square root of 3 = p/q 
Where p/q have no common divisors. Then 3 = p^2/q^2
3q^2 = p^2  Thus p^2 is divisible by 3. Then p is divisible by 3 because 3 is prime. Thus p=3k for some number.
3q^2 = 3k^2
3q^2 = 9k^2
q^2 = 3k^2  Thus q^2 is divisible by 3. Then q us divisible by 3 because 3 is prime. Thus p and q are divisible 
by 3, which is a contradiction because p and q have no common divisors. Thus square root of 3 is irrational.
